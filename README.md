# Goals: 
1. Catalyze the industry to create better low-resource language AI models by creating a popular, highly referenced destination for researchers (and the press) to compare models.
2.  Provide a place where organizations can determine which AI Speech recognition and translation models work best for their particular use case, especially with low-resource languages, starting with Indian languages. 

## Personas
1. **Producers.** Interested in making better models. Researchers primarily.
2. **Consumers.** Interested in using better models. NGOs, Orgs like PayTM, etc.


## How do we measure our success?
1. Usage by organisations -
2. Citations (for the white paper)
3. Engagement with researchers - 

## Version 0 (v0): Initial Launch PoC
### Objective:
To launch a basic version of the leaderboard with essential functionalities.

### Features:
1. Leaderboard Interface: A simple user interface showcasing basic comparison results.
2. Indian Languages Map: Integration of a map displaying the diversity of Indian languages, highlighting the need for low-resource language AI models.
3. Initial Model Set: Incorporation of basic AI models for initial testing, focusing on Hindi, Kannada, and Telugu.
4. Data Submission Interface (?): Allow organizations to submit their audio samples for testing (Gooey.ai will be a provider mentioned but since it is open-source, we can expect other companies to add such a CTA to this leaderboard).
5. Basic Comparison Algorithm: A simple algorithm to compare model performance using submitted data.
   
### Timeline: 
March 1st 2023 (4 cycles from January).

### Open Questions
1. Is the timeline feasible?
2. What would this version cost? Does this need sponsorship?


## Version 1 (v1): Expanded Capabilities with Sponsorship

### Objective:
To enhance the leaderboard with more features and broader language support.

### Features:
1. Expanded Language Support: Addition of more low-resource Indian languages.
2. Enhanced Comparison Algorithm: Improved algorithm for more accurate model comparisons.
3. Partners Integration: Onboard new partners and integrate their models into the leaderboard.

## Version 2 (v2): Advanced Features and Global Expansion
### Objective:
To position the leaderboard as a globally recognized platform for low-resource language AI model comparison.

### Features:
1. Global Language Inclusion: Expand the leaderboard to include low-resource languages from around the world.
2. Community Engagement: Foster a community for discussions, feedback, and collaborative improvements.
3. Marketing and Outreach: Intensify marketing efforts for global reach and recognition.

Timeline: October 2023.
